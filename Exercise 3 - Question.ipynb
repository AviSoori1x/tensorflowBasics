For your exercise see if you can improve MNIST to 99.8% accuracy or more using only a single convolutional layer and a single MaxPooling 2D. You should stop training once the accuracy goes above this amount. It should happen in less than 20 epochs, so it's ok to hard code the number of epochs for training, but your training must end once it hits the above metric. If it doesn't, then you'll need to redesign your layers.\n","\n","I've started the code for you -- you need to finish it!\n","\n","When 99.8% accuracy has been hit, you should print out the string \"Reached 99.8% accuracy so cancelling training!\"\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dT2vSvwr3be7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1609286160700,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":4993,"user":{"displayName":"","photoUrl":"","userId":""}},"outputId":"ee58a8f8-bf8e-4961-b5a4-f7c4c809ea35","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","\n","# YOUR CODE STARTS HERE\n","class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):\n","  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):\n","    if (logs.get('accuracy')>0.998):\n","      print('\\n Reached 99.8% in accuracy so cancelling training!')\n","      self.model.stop_training = True\n","\n","callbacks = myCallback()\n","# YOUR CODE ENDS HERE\n","\n","mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist\n","(training_images, training_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()\n","\n","# YOUR CODE STARTS HERE\n","training_images=training_images.reshape(60000, 28, 28, 1)\n","training_images=training_images / 255.0\n","test_images = test_images.reshape(10000, 28, 28, 1)\n","test_images=test_images/255.0\n","# YOUR CODE ENDS HERE\n","\n","model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([\n","    # YOUR CODE STARTS HERE\n","  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),\n","  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),\n","  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64,(3,3),activation='relu'),\n","  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),\n","  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),\n","  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n","  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n","    # YOUR CODE ENDS HERE\n","])\n","\n","# YOUR CODE STARTS HERE\n","model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n","model.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=20, callbacks=[callbacks])\n","test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)\n","print(test_acc)\n","# YOUR CODE ENDS HERE\n"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Epoch 1/20\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 83s 44ms/step - loss: 0.2811 - accuracy: 0.9117\n","Epoch 2/20\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 80s 43ms/step - loss: 0.0447 - accuracy: 0.9863\n","Epoch 3/20\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 82s 44ms/step - loss: 0.0272 - accuracy: 0.9912\n","Epoch 4/20\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 87s 47ms/step - loss: 0.0195 - accuracy: 0.9938\n","Epoch 5/20\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 81s 43ms/step - loss: 0.0150 - accuracy: 0.9953\n","Epoch 6/20\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 81s 43ms/step - loss: 0.0117 - accuracy: 0.9961\n","Epoch 7/20\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 82s 43ms/step - loss: 0.0074 - accuracy: 0.9976\n","Epoch 8/20\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 82s 44ms/step - loss: 0.0071 - accuracy: 0.9976\n","Epoch 9/20\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 77s 41ms/step - loss: 0.0056 - accuracy: 0.9979\n","Epoch 10/20\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 76s 41ms/step - loss: 0.0061 - accuracy: 0.9977\n","Epoch 11/20\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 77s 41ms/step - loss: 0.0046 - accuracy: 0.9988\n","\n"," Reached 99.8% in accuracy so cancelling training!\n","313/313 [==============================] - 4s 12ms/step - loss: 0.0299 - accuracy: 0.9932\n","0.9932000041007996\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
