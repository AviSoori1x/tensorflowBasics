# tensorflowBasics
This repository contains a set of exercises I did to study for the tensorflow developer examination. They follow some of the Google Developer videos and range from dealing with the tf 2.x API to dealing with unstructured data such as text classification, text generation and image classification. This repo will be continuously updated.
